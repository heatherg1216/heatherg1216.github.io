<p>When I was five years old I started Cheerleading for our local football league. When I was old enough I started to do competition cheerleading until I was 18 years old. Cheerleading was a huge part of my life for 14 years, and I would not have changed that for anything. I have met so many friends throughout the years, that it has essentially turned me into the person I am today. The sport became more competive in high school, and during the time I had the opportunity to be apart of the team at the Varisity level for all four years of high school. In those four years we made history at our school, by qualify for the state championship my junior and senior years. Cheering has taught me so many life lessons, and help me develop into the person I am today, and for that I will always be grateful for the opportunity to be able to play sports. </p>


<p2> Lacrosse has also been a sport I have had the opportunity to place. I strated playing lacrosse when I was in 7th grade, and still currently play club lacrosse at UMaine. Lacrosse has given me a more physical competiveness in sports,and that is why I love the game. In high school I was grateful enough to play all four years. I played on JV my first year, and then varisty the next three years, where I was also captain for my senior year. My junior year of lacrosse I blew out my knee and I thought my lacrosse career was coming to an end early. I was lucky enough to finish out the season and have surgery in the summer, and was able to make a full recovery for my senior season. I am very grateful sports are apart of my life. </p2>
